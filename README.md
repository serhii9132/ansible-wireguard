## ansible-wireguard

The repository contains an Ansible playbook for installing a WireGuard VPN server and generating the client configuration. The playbook generates a single client configuration at a time with a unique ID into the **/etc/wireguard/clients/${ID}** folder. The clientâ€™s IP address is dynamically calculated based on the number of active peers on the server.
